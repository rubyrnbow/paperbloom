  <h2 class="text-3xl font-semibold mb-6">How to Convince Others to Switch</h2>
  <ul class="list-disc ml-6 space-y-3 text-gray-800">
    <li><strong>Appeal to Emotions First:</strong> Storytelling is a powerful tool: describe how the flower pot began as discarded paper, destined for a landfill, but was transformed into something beautiful and life-giving. Let customers feel like they’re part of a redemption story every time they buy..</li>
    <li><strong>Create Attractive Product Packaging and Taglines:</strong> Use earthy tones and minimalist design to reflect the product’s eco-friendly roots. We also will use taglines like “Plant a pot, grow a future”. Include a small card that shares the impact of the purchase</li>
    <li><strong>Link it to a Bigger Purpose:</strong> Let them know their purchase contributes to something meaningful “Every pot you buy supports our mission to reduce waste and grow hope”. We will also try to partner with tree-planting or recycling initiatives.</li>
 <li><strong>Use Social Proof:</strong> Display reviews and testimonials from real customers: “I never knew going green could look this good.”. Show diverse people—families, cafés, schools, etc —using the pots in everyday life.</li>
